Fish Outta Water is a web platform designed to help anglers identify and manage invasive fish species in their local waters. By displaying a detailed map with real-time data, users can explore invasive species across the US, click on fish icons to learn scientific details and get fishing tips and recipes generated using the OpenAI API. The platform also features a social media section for users to share their fishing experiences and unique recipes. This tool aims to assist amateur and professional fishers while promoting conservation efforts.
